<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've created a tour web page. For this purpose;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I have used an async await function for fetching the data from API,</li>
  <li>By using useEffect hook and an empty dependency I've avoided from reloading data at every render,</li>
  <li>Used a loading page and a useState to store and change loading status,</li>
  <li></li>
  
  
  <li>Then added an event listener to form submit,</li>
  <li>By using an async function and Axios I've received data from "https://api.openweathermap.org",</li>
  <li>The code checks the city name then if we don't have the the city creates a card,</li>
  <li>If the city already exists in the cards or there is a problem writes an error message for 5 seconds.</li>
  <li>It's also possible to change language by clicking the flags.</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below. ðŸ‘‡ Hope you like the project! </li>
</ul>
